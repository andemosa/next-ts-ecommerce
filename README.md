# Next TS E-commerce
Rebuilt an e-commerce course with Typescript and NextJS
 - Javascript Source Code :  https://github.com/basir/next-amazona
 - Typescript Source Code : https://github.com/andemosa/next-ts-ecommerce

## What I learnt from the project
 - NextJS basics like setting up project, navigating between pages and data fetching
 - NextJS advanced topics like dynamic routing, image optimization, SSG and SSR
 - MaterialUI framework to build responsive website using custom theme
 - ReactJS including decomposing components, context API and hooks
 - Next Connect package to build backend API
 - MongoDB and Mongoose to save and retrieve data like products, orders and users
 - Using enums, interfaces and type aliases to provide type-checking for React
 - Deploy web applications on Vercel
